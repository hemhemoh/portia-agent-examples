        Analyze the user interest "{self.recipient_interest}". If it contains multiple interests
        (comma), split them and handle EACH interest separately.

        CATEGORY MAPPING (choose exactly ONE per interest):
        - AI, Arts & Culture, Climate, Fitness, Wellness, Crypto

        - AI â†’ https://lu.ma/ai

        - Wellness â†’ https://lu.ma/wellness
        - Crypto â†’ https://lu.ma/crypto

        Process the location "{self.recipient_location}" to determine the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.

        PROCEDURE:
        1) Parse interests from "{self.recipient_interest}" into a unique set (trim, lowercase for matching).
        2) For EACH mapped category (deduplicated):

            â€¢ url: the category URL above
            â€¢ location: the processed location data
        3) Filter results for events in the next 3 months from {self.today} and return in standardized format.

        Combine the results from luma_results and meetup_results.

        Apply intelligent filtering:
        1. Remove duplicates (same event on multiple platforms)
        2. Filter for events happening in/near "{self.recipient_location}" in the next 3 months starting from {self.today}
        3. Rank by relevance to "{self.recipient_interest}" using semantic matching
        4. Rank by proximity to {self.recipient_location}
        5. Ensure temporal variety across the 3-month period

        Select the top {self.no_of_events} most relevant events with good distribution across:
        - Different dates/weeks
        - Mix of platforms (Luma/Meetup)
        - High relevance scores

        Return final curated list as 'final_events' with each event containing:
